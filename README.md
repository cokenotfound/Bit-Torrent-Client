# Bit-Torrent-Client
A multi-threaded Python BitTorrent client built from scratch. Features Bencoding, concurrent peer discovery, full PWP messaging, and Rarest-First swarm optimization for verified, efficient downloading. 

## Idea
This project implemented a Python BitTorrent P2P client.

### Approach One - leveraged the high-performance libtorrent library to gain a vague understanding of the Protocol Fundamentals; while establishing a robust, production-ready system for file retrieval and cryptographic integrity checking. 

### Approach Two - constructed the client entirely from scratch, demonstrating low-level mastery of the protocol. This involved developing a bespoke Bencoding parser, managing concurrent multi-threading, and manually coding the core logic to achieve comprehensive understanding.
